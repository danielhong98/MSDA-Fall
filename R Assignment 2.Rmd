This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r}
summary(cars)
```

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r, echo=FALSE}
plot(cars)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.

#Write a function that will calculate n choose r without using the built in choose() or factorial () functions
#step 1 find a function that will multiply consecutive numbers
#step 2 calculate n choose r
#step 3 this function will only work for positive whole numbers and n > r

a <- 1
b <- 2
c <- 3
d <- 4
e <- 5

prod(1:a)
prod(1:b)
prod(1:c)
prod(1:d)
prod(1:e)

#inputs
n=5
r=3

nfactorial <- prod(1:n) #n factorial
rfactorial <- prod(1:r) #r factorial
nminrfactorial <- prod(1:(n-r)) #(n-r) factorial

dhchoose <- nfactorial/(nminrfactorial*rfactorial)
sprintf("%s choose %s = %s", n, r, dhchoose)

#test results
#5 choose 3 = 10
#7 choose 4 = 35
#10 choose 7 = 120
